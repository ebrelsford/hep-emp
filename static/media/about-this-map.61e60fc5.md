## The Environmental Monitoring Plan 2018 Interactive Map

The Interactive Map identifies active, continuous, and non-active (or historic) environmental monitoring efforts by the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP) and its many partners. The map allows users to locate monitoring sites of environmental indicators that influence the ecological health of the estuary and serves as an inventory to guide users where publically accessible data is available for download in the Hudson Raritan Estuary

The map is organized by HEP’s five goals: water quality, habitat and ecological health, port and maritime, public access and stewardship, and community engagement. Water quality is comprised of indicators used to evaluate if waters are in compliance of HEP’s goal of establishing fishable and swimmable waters. Habitat and ecological health indicators look at key estuarine habitats to evaluate changes qualitatively and quantitatively. Port and maritime focuses on the issue of legacy toxic contamination. Public access and stewardship looks at how well people are able to access the shorelines and waters for recreational purposes. Community engagement focuses on how the public is involved in decisions and stewardship of the estuary.
