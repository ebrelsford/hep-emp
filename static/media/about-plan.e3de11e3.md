## About the Environmental Monitoring Plan

The Environmental Monitoring Plan tracks the progress and effectiveness of management actions and improvement of estuarine health for 50 indicators selected by science and technical experts convened by the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP). As a component of the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), a requirement for every National Estuary Program, the Environmental Monitoring Plan identifies monitoring programs where HEP and its partners have been collecting data throughout the Hudson Raritan Estuary. Coordinating monitoring efforts, improving the timelines of data analysis, and making data available to a diverse audience are some of the challenges that this plan aims to address. The Environmental Monitoring Plan has been adapted into three tools: the interactive map, the environmental monitoring plan storymap, and the memo of monitoring recommendations. Each component of the Environmental Monitoring Plan 2018 is accessible by visiting www.hudsonriver.org.
