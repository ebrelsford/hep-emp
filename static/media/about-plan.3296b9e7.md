## About the Environmental Monitoring Plan

Environmental monitoring is critical for tracking the health of the estuary, and the progress and effectiveness of management actions. Fifty-one indicators, selected by scientific and technical experts convened by the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP), can help us understand and document progress towards improvements in water quality, habitat, public access, maritime use, and community engagement.

To help coordinate these monitoring efforts, improve data analysis, and make data available, HEP has produced an Environmental Monitoring Plan.  The Environmental Monitoring Plan also identifies priorities for future environmental monitoring, including gaps in currently available data. There are three tools: an interactive map, a companion digital storymap, and a monitoring recommendations report.  All of the resources outlined below are accessible by visiting [www.hudsonriver.org/article/environmental-monitoring-plan](http://www.hudsonriver.org/article/environmental-monitoring-plan).
