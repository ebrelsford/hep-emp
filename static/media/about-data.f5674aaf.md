## About the Data

Each point or polygon on the map reflects either a monitoring station, a general site location, and/or an area of monitoring for environmental programs conducted in the Hudson Raritan Estuary. Programs displayed on the interactive map monitor for indicators identified by a science and technical advisory committee, work groups, and citizen advisory committees hosted by HEP. A full inventory catalog is downloadable from the map, which includes monitoring programs not displayed on the map. Statewide or regional programs that proved difficult to map, academic or journal publications, and other monitoring programs where data is not publically accessible was removed from the visualization of the interactive map.
